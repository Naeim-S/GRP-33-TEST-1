The format of these ID's is a 2-3 letter country code, followed by a integer identifying the specific station. A simple approach is to assume a fixed length of the country ID. A more complex way would be to use the [`re`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) module."

I ordered the part and paid about $40.00 including shipping, and received the kit promptly.  The part was not the correct part for my vehicle.  PartsGeek is willing to refund my money upon me returning the filter kit.  It will cost me $14.95 to ship the kit back. The problem is the PartsGeek website is flawed and not detailed enough to make sure customers are ordering the correct parts.  I own four vehicles and do all my maintenance myself.  I order all the time from Rock Auto, Summit and A1 Auto.  Never had a problem with them.  Not sure I'll give PartsGeek another chance.\n",

      "I bought the \"Executive Package\" because I really wanted a resume that helped me stand out, both on paper and online.  The reviews were awesome (now I'm wondering if they were faked, I guess I will find out when I see if this is ever posted), so I decided to go for it.\r\n",

      "VERY disappointed to say the least.  After receiving my first and second drafts, I asked that I be bumped down to the $99 service since I lost all faith and really didn't want them touching my LinkedIn profile based on the quality I was seeing, and the first draft cover letter they formed was useless.  They promptly replied, \"sorry no refunds, and no discounts\" - even though I have no plans for them to complete the services included in the package.  So now I'm stuck paying for something I didn't get.\r\n",

      "My advice?  Look up some nice templates online (that is all they will really do for you) and some basic resume tips and tricks (i.e. keep it to 1 to 2 pages)... these are all FREE and readily available online.  There is no \"professional writing\" and keyword optimization based on ANY (my writer admitted she had none) industry knowledge you are targeting or even for the job you are wanting.\n",

      "I've travelled to almost 40 countries and took many tours but this tour was the worst experience I have ever had. It is poorly designed and executed, here's the things that went wrong:\n",
      "-Weeks before our trip to Peru, we contacted Viator to add Huayna Picchu experience to our tour, after 4 attempts and various email confirmations, we sent your request to local tour operator, etc. nothing came out of it. \n",
      "-We weren't picked up from our central Cusco hotel by bus but had to walk with our heavy bags to 3 different locations in the city before being picked up, the bus left Cusco 45 minutes lateor one hour and 10 min from the time we were met by a guide at our hotel\n",
      "-At our first stop, Pisac market we were given 15 min ONLY to see the market which is this big, incredible place, what a waste! At the next stop, the Pisac ruins, we had to remind the guide we were suppose to get tickets for the ruins, he then lined up to buy them, we had to wait for a bit, get back on the bus, wait for the bus to park, and were given only 30 min to see the ruins, a lot of time was wasted, it took us at least 10 min to find our way back to the bus which was parked at a different spot far away from the ruins entrance. We got to spent about 15-20 minutes at the ruins, again not enough time.\n",
      "-Next stop, Ollantaytambo, again we were given 30-40 min max 15 of which were spent listening to the guide before even venturing to the ruins, this place is huge we had to run through it, there was no time for a toilet break, but our trouble really started once we arrived to Aguas Calientes the Machu Picchu village in the evening\n",
      "-We were told by the guide in Cusco that we will be met by a local guide and receive all the Machu Picchu details that night, however no one showed up, we did not have MP tickets nor the departure time next morning. After waiting for a couple of hours and spending time around the phone, over 4 hours later we finely found out the pick up time. Next morning the guide who picked us up, asked me to line up for the MP bus tickets and sent my friend to an office to pick up MP tickets. Once my friend got there, she was scolded by the office person who asked her where her guide was as she was not supposed to issue tickets to her but a guide only. Finally, the office person made an exception and we made it to the MP grounds entrance, we were yet again supposed to be met by another guide, it was 7:30 am and the guide didn't show up until after 9 am!! We were so tired and frustrated by this point as we had very little sleep having had to spend the previous night trying to find out the tour details. When they showed up the guide asked us to join another group, the new guide was repeating the same things over and over again, he wasn't very knowledgeable and was also translating everything for a sole spanish-speaking person in the group, the whole thing was quite a disappointment! Viator and their local operators run extremely bad business, I would never recommend this tour to anyone.\n",

      "Made the mistake of signing up for a basic membership. Didn't realize that with basic, there's no consolidation, so I got some $1 used books shipped to me at a cost of $35 each. Was my fault, but it would have been nice if the system alerts you to crazy situations and says \"hey, you'd save a lot of money by going premium and consolidating these books.\" Their support guy Tyler M was great, and the interface is great, so I signed up for premium.

I called Customer Service to explain that I wanted another 100 bags but found the postage to be prohibitive.  I am the Infantwear Buyer for the Assistance League of Austin and package onesies in the small baggies for donating to at-risk and under-served preemies and infants at Dell Children's Hospital.  The person I spoke with graciously offered to send another package for $2 shipping.  I appreciated that very much but then wondered why the original shipping was $7.25 if the product could be shipped for $2.  For the additional $5.25 that I paid the first time, I could've had another 100 bags for $4 with a little left over!  That would've been great!  Since I am spending the Assistance League's money, I am especially aware of extra spending.  Thank you for a good product and fast shipping, but not the $7.25 shipping cost!\n",

You have over 2000 cars parked on top of each other in various lots some marked some not, in no apparent order and on top of each other with the keys left in the car and the doors unlocked. You have no idea where any of these cars are parked. Management and many of your staff were very rude and basically could care less about all the families you left stranded. It was only because of one sympathetic employee that my car was found. It took us 20 minutes driving and walking up down several very poorly lit lots before I found my car. Some of the lots are not even paved and are covered in straw. A few of us as a last resort, called the police and when they arrived they said they come to your business for the same reason at least once a week. Your staff offered no explanation, no compensation. Whatever business model you are using, it does not work. Your greed will end up biting you in the butt. ANYONE THAT READS THIS,  DO NOT PARK YOUR CAR HERE. SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GO TO A REPUTABLE PARK AND FLY LOCATION.\n",

Ryan was great and provided great communication and a quick turn around.  We selected the product, submitted the artwork and what we wanted printed (we went with 16gb jump drives).  Ryan quickly prepared a draft for approval and was able to begin having the order processed.  We started process on a Thursday morning, approval by early afternoon, payment in the afternoon (was real easy to submit payment), and I received the product by Tuesday the following week, which was pretty good in my opinion, especially over a holiday weekend.  This was a fast, easy, and pleasant transaction.  Ryan's communication and support was great.  We will definitely look to Ryan and Flashbay for our future needs.\r\n",

      "I found Vidarjewelry on Etsy the first week of March.  I found the perfect engagement ring for my soon to be fiancé and knew that I had to have it.  I contacted Roi and asked if it was possible to have the stone changed in the ring to an Aquamarine and sure enough it was!  I purchased the ring on March 1 and today, March 11, I received it!  The craftsmanship is stunning and the ring is perfect. Roi worked with me every step of the way from offering ways to size her without her knowing, to shipping options to just keeping me posted on the progress.  Roi was incredibly easy to work with and I could not recommend someone more!  His work is one of a kind and absoultey stunning.  On top of that, there was an appraisal of the ring with it and THE BOX HAS AN LED LIGHT IN IT!! As a theatre professional, that little detail makes me smile and laugh and appreciate the obvious pride he takes in his work.  Thank you Roi and the Vidarjewelry team for making this the best experience I've had buying jewelry and for making an incredible piece for me! \n",

      "I am very disappointed in Gilt. Zulily which I thought wasn't as big as Gilt delivers a hundred times better customer service. I ordered a father's day gift, a pair of shoes (Order #86480346) on June 10, 2017. My order shipped on June 14, I never received them. Based on details from the tracking number, the package got to my city (actually had the 'out for delivery' update so you can imagine my over excitement like a groom waiting for his bride) but were sent back to sender for reasons I do not know. Using the tracking number I was given when the order shipped, the last update was on the 25th of June with delivery still pending. I have sent emails and called and Gilt representatives insist I have to wait till they receive the returned package before I get my refund of $288.33! Why I should wait indefinitely for my money for a fault that is not mine boggles my mind! Almost a month after I placed my order, an email from one of Gilt's reps on July 5 stated that I could wait for as long as 3 MONTHS & if I didn't get a refund after this time frame I could get in touch again! Ludicrous! Why should a brand with integrity hold on to my money till they receive the returned package. So now I don't have my money nor do I have my purchase and then I should keep paying interest on this money Gilt has. I wonder what will happen if this returned order somehow gets missing in transit and they never receive it, I honestly doubt they will notice. I don't think anyone at Gilt customer service is abreast of this type of failed transaction. The burden seems to fall totally on the unfortunate customer that is caught up in this unfortunate circumstance to chase for a refund.\n",

The fact that my daughter has dyslexia and ADHD does not help this fact, nor does the fact I work with students who have special needs. Because of this, after my daughter had been in two different schools, and with my experience in several schools and districts, I knew I had to make homeschool work for her.

Also, since the work was online there were no more worries about whether or not it would get turned in to the teacher.

      "I am a committed bike commuter. Preparing to buy a house in north Seattle, but working on capitol hill, I have hills both ways, about a 7 mile commute, and have spent too many mornings and evenings mopping sweat as I arrive to work and back home, particularly on warmer days (>50 degrees does it for me!).  I am cruising up the hills with guilt-inducing speed, MUCH cooler, and still get a good workout. Cycling on the flats at my usual cruising speed ~20 mph is beyond the e-assist speed, but this feels fine. My road bike is notably heavier and handles a little differently with the additional weight in the front, but it's small and I will learn quickly. I have been a little surprised to find that there is a barely perceptible drag when I am cruising... it's not the additional weight. It MIGHT be the transition from e-assist to my own power. I worry that it is something electrical intrinsic to an electric motor. If I didn't have the big hills, and were out for a mostly flat cruise, I would be tempted to switch out to my old front wheel. If I had my kiddos in the bike trailer, I would definitely stick with the Hill-topper wheel (AKA wind-stopper AKA tot-hauler).

      "I consider tripadvisor as my first go-to resource when planning vacations.  I love the helpful reviews and member photos.  I often receive helpful tips on which rooms to request or which entrees are not to be missed.  I never hesitate to trust tripadvisor reviews for restaurants although I am beginning to have to exercise more caution when considering accommodation and activity reviews.  If a reviewer has many posts and previous reviews, I will trust them.  But often I am finding that a near-the-top-ranked  hotel or tour company, for example, might have MANY reviews that seem questionable.  The reviewer only has 1 or 2 previous reviews and maybe no (or 1-2) forum posts and says generic things.  If I see too many of this type of review for an establishment, I don't trust their ranking. It makes me question whether or not they are paying people to write reviews for them (I've read that reviews can be \"bought\").  So, all in all, I still view tripadvisor to be a valuable resource but at time I am suspicious of the authenticity of some of the reviews.\n",

      "Their price for Blue dog food is comparable to Petsmart. Instead of driving to Petsmart to buy a heavy bag of dog food, I now order from Petflow and orders over $49 have free shipping. With Petflow, it still costs about $1.00 more than if I were to go to Petsmart, however, I don't think there is any tax AND I don't have to pay for gas to get there. I think it evens out in the end, or quite possibly, it is cheaper to order from Petflow! Thanks, Petflow!\n",

      "Looking for a quick service avaliable for my iPhone 5C, I needed something to clear up some unlocking requests so the phone could be used internationally for family use. The issue was the phone was bought by a 3rd party and when unlocking, it would return an unable to unlock due to unpaid history. This was annoying since I really needed the phone to work and ended up using the service. At first, they charged $17 USA to run a semi unlock. Within a week, they emailed back saying I needed a premium unlock which costed an additional $63 USA. The total was about $80 to unlock but after a total amount of 20 whole days from start date to end with unlock email, it was successful. Took a while considering the time frame was said to be 3-15 days but better late then never. Thank you for the good service!\n",

These were not readily available here in Canada. Even my local bike shop was unwilling to source them out for me. Xxcycle did a great job packaging and shipping it in a timely manner.

      "We ended up doing most of the work for their Title Company as they could not contact two banks (we did on the first try).  The process and review took over FOUR (4) months.  We provided documentation, copies, and had a Notary Public come to our house twice.  The program that was signed up for went all the way to \"we're in the home stretch\" as noted by our representative.  Then the home stretch lasted another month and a half.  One week prior to closing we were told they had to change programs due to previous transactions (which we told them from the start).  Now they moved us to a \"Fresh Start\" program which provided us with LESS THAN HALF of the money we were told we would get, THEN instead of being able to draw on the equity again next year they said we could not.  The ENTIRE program changed.  We were stuck between a rock and a hard place.  If we had another option (at that point they have you), we would have taken it.  WE WERE NOT HAPPY with what we got or any of the constant changes throughout the process.  GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING UP FRONT!!!\n",

      "I am highly upset and frustrated at this point. I called square trade to get repairs done to my Iphone 7 that i purchased of purchasing power on Sept 8, 2017... the person who assisted me with my claim was very polite and helpful. He filed my claim and sent me the shipping label and told me it would be better if i sent my phone in on Monday so that i can have my phone by Wednesday per the overnight shipping that he stated was so easy and convenient.  The shipping instructions was plain and simple and i followed them and mailed my phone off on Sept 11th. I received and email stating that my phone was shipped and that it was received on Tues Sept 11 @1000am. So going off the gentleman i spoke to i figured my phone will be fixed that day and shipped to me that night to be received on Wednesday. I didn't receive and update and so i contacted square trade for an update. The gentleman stated that yes the phone is in the process of repairs and i should receive my phone on Thursday. i was ok with a day delay. Thursday comes and i still have not receive an update on the phone. Friday comes and i contact again. The young lady states that an email was sent to me to turn of find my iphone and that I need to respond to email in order to start repairs. By now i am livid because none of this was communicated to me and from my understanding and the last conversation i had was that my phone was getting repaired. In the instructions before sending i should have been instructed to turn off find my iphone before shipping but i wasn't. And also each time i mad contact i shouldn't have been told different instructions and updates. Its is now Monday and contact them again in regards to my claim, the teller states that they received the confirmation in regards to my phone and will start repairs today and i will receive a confirmation withing 24/48hours. What was supposed to be a 2-3 day thing turned into a whole week. I am a mother with two young children and to be without a phone for a week is ridiculous especially when most companies don't give out loaner phones which in my case my service doesn't. I pay for the coverage so that this kind of thing doesn't happen and i thought i was going to be guaranteed that my phone would be back 2-3 days flat. The tellers were all telling me different things and now i have to wait and extra maybe 24 to 48 hours to get an update and maybe another few days before i actually get my phone sent back to me fixed. A full 8 days and my phone isn't repaired and sent back to me. I am highly upset and i will never do this again nor refer  anybody to use squaretrade.!!!\n",

I talked to my husband and placed my order on Monday around 2 PM (it was so affordable to, shipping was $8!).  Sure enough today around 2 PM my new grill was waiting for me at my house.

Being able to speak directly with my delivery guy while in route was so nice. When you're having a $50,000 boat delivered from Arizona to Ohio it's good to know that things were going smoothly! I will definitely use them again for any other long distance purchases and I suggest you do the same!\n",

Unfortunately the person that did the packing sent me only 5 Careprosts instead of the 6 I ordered....I emailed them explaining what happened, and they assured me that they would send me the tracking number (withing 3 days)  of the one  bottle, that was missing..... They will mail it to me, so that made me happy...... I will definitely order from this company again in the future, they have excellent customer service!!!!

      "VRBO is great . I have used it for years. However, The price per night while searching is frustrating. I take time to open it up only to find that in some cases the price per night ends up being double what’s posted. For example.... I put dates in that I need. Possibly  Searching for 150 dollar a night property for two nights. Two nights should not end up being 600.It’s a waste of time in my search especially when I am narrowing my search down to price per night. I understand fees and taxes but when those fees are excessive it’s frustrating and price per night seems pointless.\n",

      "On a personal note, our beloved 3 year old dog contracted a serious infection, was hospitalized for 10 days, and tragically died of a blood clot to the brain when all other systems were on the mend. During this terrible time, it was comforting to know that we could make important care decisions without concerns about cost. Trupanion reimbursed us quickly for 90% of everything less the one time deductible and the small administrative fees. During a time of stress and ultimately grief, Trupanion came through. \n",
      "We experienced, and I hear from my clients, that Trupanion lacks the bureaucracy of other plans. The plan options are uncomplicated compared to others, and I take great comfort in knowing that the Plan's underwriter is owned by Trupanion. My last pet plan switched its underwriter, and suddenly our costs increased and we had a plan with less desirable coverage. \n",

My discover card is not on my dashboard, I have called Cecilia De Leon numerous times and have left at least 3 or 4 messages and no return calls. So I sent in a service request, case # 3325484 and explained my problem and they responded to me that if I want to add an account to contact that department. Obviously that didn't take the time to read the entire letter I sent them to give me that response. So this has been 3 or 4 weeks now and I was told by Cecilia that if I had any problems or questions to just give her a call and I feel like know one with your company cares, they got there money and that's it. So I would appreciate if someone would please take care of this and give me a call or I have no choice but to stop payments and find another company.\n",

      "Ok heres my timeline. Ordered frames on Jan 2nd, billing and shipping didn't match up ok so I fixed it by Jan 4th. Order started processing and billed on Jan 6th. By Jan 10th still processing so I decide to change the size of the frames. Jan 11th Order Cancelled due to \"no stock\" in that size, ok no problem. Website stated refund issued immediately and should be posted to my account within 3 business days ok great. Jan 13th still no refund, contacted customer service via email because I like everything in writing. Was told by rep to wait 1 to 5 business days, fine. Well it's Jan 23rd now and still no refund. Sent them another e-mail Jan 21st and no response. Sent them another e-mail directly from website today and will wait for response. By end of this week if I have not received my refund I will be contacting my credit card company to report them for fraud. This has been a terrible experience with Go-Optic if you want to risk it then it's up to you but by the looks of it, a lot of people are unhappy with their service.They are not accredited with BBB yet have a 1 star rating with BBB hhhmmm interesting.

Then, I click the contact person in the sky picker website, i try to ask for a help and tweet them in twitter. They respond me and I saw they really work hard in helping me, if I am not mistaken it takes 12 hours to finished my trouble. I am so grateful because I was booking a ticket in a right place, \"Sky Picker\", for me it is a trusted company with an excellent service, so I put 5 star ratings to this. I also recommend this company to my friend, her name is athya I recommend her to book a ticket in sky picker, because it provide the cheapest flight and also good service in way to pleasent to consument. \r\n",

I have a mail thread with rentalcars customer support with official apologies and confirmation of internal error caused this incident. Plus I have the same mail confirmation from customer support that E class will be booked for me from another vendor. As a result today I received a notice that no one is responsible and nothing will be changed.

      "I will no longer do business with Kohl’s. I ordered an item online that they delivered to an incorrect address and state. I had to call 7 separate times to find out after one month they no longer carry the item I ordered. Then I got the run around about my refund to my credit card and the gift card I also used.  Kohl’s must not be aware there are plenty of online websites that give superior service compared to them.  I will never torture myself again with any purchase from Kohl’s. Even after calling the corporate phone number twice I still never received a phone call back.\n",
      "Priceline advertised a breakfast as being included in the price of our hotel. By chance, when speaking directly with the hotel, we found out no breakfast was available. When we called Priceline back, we were given the run-around trying to get answers on this - one person even hung up on us/cut us off when she couldn't help us with this issue. Now, Priceline is in the process of looking into possibly refunding the approximate value ($10/person) of a breakfast. We'll see how that goes. Next time, I would not use Priceline, as it has been a hassle just dealing with this one issue. I'd hate to see if there was anything issue more complex.\n",

They offer free shipping on $10 or more orders and that's great because the prices of the items are very reasonable.

When I arrived back in Newark, I was picked up immediately and my vehicle was ready with the trunk open for my luggage.  My only complaint was that I had paid the $30 + fees for the premium car wash wash, and that was terrible if done at all.  The car was dirty and windows poorly cleaned.  So, next time I don't get that.  Otherwise, a good place to park.\n",
      "I purchased a $250 impact controller including the premium build time. I received the controller 3 days later and I realized the adjustable triggers are broken. They work but they feel like they will break anytime soon. I contacted support and they advised me to fix it myself by using the scuf key they sent with it. I then realized that the key does not even work for the adjustable triggers because the triggers are broken inside. Also the d-pad feel worn out. I contacted support and they told me I can even get a refund with a possible restocking fee, or I can send it in for repair which would take weeks to get it back. So the premium build time was a total waste of money because they did not even bother to put together a proper product. I honestly would not mind going through the hassle of getting the product fixed if the controller was in the $80-$100 range. That makes sense because companies can have lazy staff here and there that can ruin the products quality. But when you buy a $250 controller you expect real quality and if not then you want to get a solid customer support. I felt like talking to a robot when I contacted customer support.\n",

We had to wait for it to be cleaned. The guy cleaning the van was clearly upset and complaining about being asked to clean it!  You could hear everything he was yelling about as he threw things in the back room, while complaining Leslie had asked him to clean it. Needless to say, the van was not cleaned to our expectations (carpet not vacuumed, and outside a mess).  For a 2018 GMC the van was a terrible ride!!  Not near enough cup holders for a 12 seater, and it had so many rattles the trip was miserable.  Some customer service training might be beneficial for AVR as Leslie was short and rude with a room full of customers waiting.  Will not rent from AVR again.  Over priced for what we got.  Would not recommend at all.  Will drive two vehicles next time.  TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE from pick up to drop off!  Can I get a REFUND?  No recommendation from me.\n",

You guys never notified me that my tickets were available it was me calling your company, and finally getting somebody on the phone, I believe his name is Tyler who is able to get me the tickets emailed. I will never use your company again, and I will definitely be telling people I know never to use your company. A brutal experience, I’m only Being honest. \n",

He talked about how they power level accounts and convinced me that he needed my login details so he could drop trade it over(again I was dumb enough to fall for this).

The seller was very helpful and the dress is in excellent condition and well done ... but I will have to find a solution because it's a bit tight on the bust and I can't completely close the zip on the back side. The only thing I didn't expect are the extra customs fees I had to pay (about 22 US). The fabric and the model are gorgeous, I'm really glad to have this vintage dress! 8-)\n",

I was bidding on like 4 other basketballs and could've paid a little more for the same thing without the \"Smudge!\" I DIDN'T ask for a refund or return. I asked for a credit since I would be ordering a lot of items to finish my man-cave, give out gifts, and trades with my collector friends.

      "I booked 3 tickets on eDreams, and we got an immediate confirmation, and I also did online check in and got the boarding pass, the airline was vueling, and on the gate we got rejected and the reason was that the payment didn't go through for technical error, and the only way for us to get on the plane is to go immediately to vueling office to do the payment, and that was in Barcelona airport, so we ran all the way to their offices but it was already to late and the gate was closed, and they confirmed to us 100% that the payment didn't go through and thats the reason. then we booked a new flight and traveled and ignored the bad experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, by 2 weeks, eDreams somehow decided to charge the amount like if nothing had happened! so we contacted them and they said its vueling fault and you should claim the money from them, we went to vueling they said the same and we should claim it from eDreams. So they took us in a loop which in my opinion has the same attitude of pirates! we had to chase them down for 2 month till finally eDreams admitted their mistake and agreed to refund the money. After 2 weeks we got the money missing almost 30%, and when we asked why? they said 30% service charge!!! what kind of service is that? We have been forced on the gate not to board the flight, we ran in the airport right and left and still missed the flight, we have been charged after the app failed to make the booking right, we have been fighting and chasing them to get the money back, so how come you could justify the service fees?\n",

Broker said twice it wasn't possible to close on the same day, then the morning of said maybe it was possible....back and forth. After we saw the boat and we're waiting (again) to hear from the broker about closing, I went around him and spoke to the closing coordinator, who actually new what she was doing and said it would be no problem to close same day (apparently the broker had no idea of this.) We also wasted about 1.5 hours because the broker didn't make an effort to have the boat delivered to the closing office as we requested- which instead causes us to travel out of our way twice when we didn't need to. There was no customer service from the broker- nothing was done by him to make the process as seamless as possible. I feel he didn't have any experience in sales or in customer service. We were able to close the same day, which is not the norm for this company. With a different broker I would give them another shot.\n",

      "After reading reviews from other buyers, I was relatively certain this was going to be a horrible experience, but I just couldn't resist the price. $42.00 for The Insanity workout set?  They normally retail for $170!!!  That's an insane discount and they even threw in free shipping.  They had a pretty good return policy, so I figured if it didn't work, I'd just return it.  It came two days later (via FedEx) in a beachbody box (they are the company who manufactures the workout DVDs).  I opened it to find exactly what was promised...a brand new, factory sealed set with all the fixings.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the package did contain an order receipt for a value much higher than what I paid.  The slip does note that it is an order receipt and not an invoice.  I checked my bank statements and I wasn't charged the higher price (which was the full price for the set and $130 more than what I paid).  In the end...I couldn't be happier. I would DEFINITELY recommend.\n",

Also, the skirt was much to big for a \"small\". They tempt you with slashed prices, but as there is a no returns policy for sale items, it really is a waste of money. Not sure if these a re sellable either, because I wouldn't want to sell someone unwearable clothes, it would be unfair.\n",

Today is the 12,  mother's day has passed and when I check on my order status they still have not even shipped!  I had to email customer service 3 times before I finally got a response.  And the reply was not satisfactory!  First they said I did not order by cutoff date...I ordered by cutoff and have email confirmation to prove.  Then they said in order to receive guaranteed  delivery you had to choose urgent delivery!   Really?  Because it did not say that in your advertisement for guaranteed delivery and when I was checking out I saw no urgent delivery option.  Long story short my wife still has no mother's day present!

      "The entire pricing and installation Leaf Filter process was a disaster from my perspective. The actions of everyone involved reflected poorly on the company and its ethical practices. The Sales Representative Domonick Tagliava made numerous statements that in the end were not true and the actual price seem to endlessly descend as long as I refused to commit. To be specific Domonick said the installers would be \"Leaf Filter\" permanent employees and not sub contractors and the actual system would be attached 16\" on center to match my roof rafters. Two primary reasons I selected Leaf Filter over Gutter Guard & Leaf Guard. The silly discounts Domonick offered (paying by check, installing right way, $200 trade show discount, deciding today, etc...) it was all unprofessional and lack transparency. I still don't know if I got a \"fair\" price. How could I recommend you?\r\n",
      "The installation team arrived two hours late, none were Leaf Filter employees, only one spoke broken English at best; all were from South America. I spoke with their supervisor and was told there were no Leaf Filter installers. Their appearance and that of their vehicle (van) was very unprofessional...  \"unnerving from a security perspective\". The installation was haphazard, clear adhesive/sealant was applied to both the clutters and the screening carelessly (the excess thrown on the ground or dripped onto the wall); screws/clips/gutter nails were everywhere, vinyl dust & pieces were left as the fell. In short the entire installation reflected poorly on the company. Afterwards I was presented an invoice that had the incorrect amount and co-erst to signing a document saying they had cleaned up after themselves. Which was not the case.\r\n",
      "In no way could I recommend Leaf Filter to anyone. I can not say the product will work as it has not rained since installation; but I can say the commercial and installation side of the my experience was a nightmare. Stephen Avery\n",

      "I am especially fond of the Sport Strap, which is great for keeping the strap in place while shooting. I also use the double strap for event work and enjoy the comfort and performance it provides. The price point is right and is a great value for the money. I also like the thoughtful accessories one can use with the straps like the Lockstar, that keeps the ConnectR lock securely in place so there are no accidental detachments of the camera from the straps. I also like the Protectr that has a metal wire that prevents the strap from being cut by a thief, who could otherwise steal one's camera if not alert. Get this accessory for each strap!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Prior to using BlackRapid straps, I used similar straps from a well known German company in the camera strap world. Both are very good and have their merits and room for improvement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have had a chance to use both brands enough to make a fair comparison from a professional point of view. The BlackRapid straps are lighter and just as comfortable as their German counterparts, which is great for long events wearing two heavy cameras and are more easily managed when transporting them. BlackRapid has a nicer price point.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only criticism I have with the BlackRapid system is the connector plate that affixes to the camera. I would prefer a connector plate that rotates in such a fashion that does not allow for it to loosen up under any circumstance. I am the king of over torquing things, but found myself having to re-tighten the connector plate several times, in spite of the design with the carabiner. I realize this may not be a problem for some, but I use 2 Canon 5d Mark IIIs with battery grips and a 70-200mm on one camera with the dual strap ( attach the strap to the lens in this case), so they are heavy as camera rigs go and I don't like the distraction of re-tightening connector plates for fear of a camera becoming detached. That said, BlackRapid is innovative, which I love, so I would love to see this addressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In conclusion, save for my only real concern mentioned above,  the BlackRapid products I own are first-class and are a joy to use. I would recommend their products to anyone looking for a great camera strap or harness.\n",

      "Take care of this company! Wizz Air has evidently as business concept to charge exorbitant fees. I passed together with 30 other passengers in their luggage trap which consists of special luggage rules. All of the companies I have flown with allows a cabin suitcase 55x40x20 cm. and a small shoulder bag.  Wizz-Air just allows a cabin suitcase 42x32x25 cm and zero handbag. Me and my wife had 2 suitcases 50x38x20 and each a small shoulder bag with camera, toilet kit, book and newspaper for the trip. Because our cabin suitcases was too big we had to pay extra. But because we had the small shoulderbag we had two pieces of luggage, when only one was allowed. And we had to pay for that too. This cost us 260 Euro while plane tickets cost 22 Euro. When something is too cheap to b true – it is normally not true. This was no exeption.\n",

      "I reserved a unit early on a Monday morning. The process online was super easy and quick. I received a call shortly after from my local Life Storage center that I could come by anytime that day before closing (6 PM) to get my keys - no other information given.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I was also planning on moving in that same day. I borrowed two trucks from friends and hired a babysitter to watch our son while my husband and I loaded up all of my stuff to be moved in. We show up to Life Storage at 1:30 PM to grab the keys and move everything in, but as a surprise to us, the offices were closed. They had a sign on the door saying they were all out for lunch and would be back in an hour. I was quite annoyed because there was no mention that they'd be closed for lunch in the phone call I received (he said I could come by anytime before 6 PM). And now we had 2 truckloads of boxes that had to be taken back and unloaded so we could get the trucks back and we had to go pick up our son as the sitter could only keep him until 2 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "After going through all of that hassle, I did not want to lose my unit so later that afternoon I ran by the center to sign the contract and get my keys (still not sure when I will ACTUALLY be able to move in). \n",
      "\n",
      "I show up and casually let the guys at the front desk know that I was a bit frustrated because I had shown up earlier in the day to move in and no one was here and it caused a huge hassle for us. The guy at the front desk did not even acknowledge me. Not even an apology. He literally ignored that I had said anything and just asked me for my drivers license. \n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't seem worth causing a scene so I just moved along with the check-in process. A few minutes later he asked me when I was planning on moving in, and I told him I didn't know anymore because we just had to take all of my stuff back and unload it and had to take the trucks we borrowed back because they were closed when we showed up. Again, he COMPLETELY ignored me. Didn't even acknowledge that I said anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "I get that things happen. The fact that they were closed for an hour during the middle of the day when I was told I could come anytime was annoying, but it happens. But to completely ignore a customer who is voicing a complaint is just bad business. At best I was hoping to have the $25 administrative fee waived for our trouble and at the very least I thought I would get an apology. I got neither. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, the storage center seems nice, clean, and functional. Just call ahead before showing up to make sure someone will in fact be in the office (even if they said they will). Having to move is already a stressful event in itself, so this bad customer experience made it even worse. \n",

      "I recently purchased a 'desktop replacement' laptop through XoticPC and I have to say they are far and above the best of the best. I wont name any other names, but I had gone through 5 other companies to try and purchase a similar laptop. Trying to find a group of people who could give me a straightforward and honest idea of what I was going to end up spending, the timeframe of when I would receive my laptop, etc. All 5 gave me the runaround, and then XoticPC came through with flying colors. I honestly wish I could give them 6/5 stars because they even dealt with my terrible attitude I had left over from the other 5 companies being so false and impossible to deal with. Even with that, they kept their cool, reassured me, and dealt with me kindly and professionally through the whole process. I will not buy another custom built system from another company. Hands down. Bravo to the last internet company to provide old fashioned, timely, and honest customer service.\n",

They want you to cancel by the 1st which was 2 days after I received the box. I notified them on the 2nd of October which only gave me three days to try the box. They wouldn't cancel it and they charged my credit card $265. The products are ok and I would never want another box. I never write reviews but people need to know what they are getting into with this company. I actually tried to cancel back in August and the representative said that she would love me to try the product first. I guess what she meant by that was you would get a day to try the product and if you don't cancel we will charge you 6 months worth of boxes. Most companies charge once a month and this is how they screw you over. You can't get a hold of anyone either via phone.

In fact, they haven't even responded to the four emails I have sent them today asking for a manager to call me. This issue is NOT resolved and they should be sued.

When we called to figure out what happened they said that it was \"just sitting on a shelf and that it would be shipped within a few days\" thats when we recieved it 2 1/2 weeks later. So we got it and i took it out of the box and was imediatly floored. They screwed up what she ordered the text that she got on the controller was in the wrong color and in the wrong font wich makes the controller as a whole ruined. And the so called \"mods\" that it comes with dont work on battlefield or call of duty which are both advertised on the site. And to top it off there were no instructions on how to use the mods or even find out which ones your using.

      "I have ordered from this place before, and have never had a problem, so when I saw they had all 5 of my required textbooks for class, I jumped on that. That being said, I ave never had such poor service when dealing with any other site in general as I have with this particular order. I was given a tracking device, like most book renting companies do, and every once in a while I would check on it. That is until the tracking number stated my books were delivered... to Tennesesee. The last time I was in Tennessee was when I was about 14, and just passing through. I contacted the site via email (because this site does not offer a phone number) explaining my concerns. I received an email back essentially saying I could not complain about my books not being delivered until the estimated delivery time expired, even though my tracking number has updated to \"DELIVERED\". So I waited until I had time to contact them again (a day later) via chat. The customer service rep told me yes, the books were delivered to Tennessee, but he can't do anything about it (weather that be reimburse me or re-sending the textbooks) until the delivery date expired. He then told me to contact USPS about my shipment. After 45 minutes of talking to a robot, I finally got a person on the phone who told me the exact same this as everyone else, except he would try to resend the package, but I should just wait until the USPS in Tennessee calls me because they have my books. I called them, they say the books have been sent back to the original address from which they were shipped because they don't hold packages. Class has already started, and I need these books for homework and studying purposes, which is why I ordered them before class started. If I get my books (and I mean if) I sincerely doubt I will be renting from this site again.\n",

      "After five years it was time for me to replace the carbon media in my PC-600.  I called Customer Service for assistance.  They were friendly and informative, however, that did not prevent me from having an unfavorable experience.  First, it costs over $200 for the carbon replacement kit, which is basically a sack of coconut shell carbon plus about $10 worth of plastic parts.  The replacement job is tricky, but it is expected to be a DIY.  I did try calling two of the plumbers on the recommended list supplied by Pelican, including the company that installed the system, but neither returned my call.  Pelican did supply a YouTube link which clearly explains the procedure, so I endeavored to do the job myself.  Every step of the way I watched the video, and reviewed the written instructions and it went flawlessly up to the point where I emptied and discarded the old media, poured in new media, and left it soaking for 48 hours.  The covering for my tube was made of plastic and it disintegrated when I removed it.  I reported this to Customer Service and they informed me that Pelican discontinued using plastic, my five year old system did not guarantee replacement, and I would have to purchase as stainless steel cover from them for $143.  So the 48-hour soaking period was extended several days while I waited for the new tube covering.  When the covering came, it did not fit over my tube.  Customer Service was pleasant and agreed to send me a new tube for no extra cost.  I had to wait another week for it to arrive.  Then I had to empty the soaked media from the old tube, remove the down tube and place it in the new tank, and carefully pour in the soaked media into the new tank.  Now I am in the 72-hour period of not using high flow appliances, such as laundry and dish washer, and my water will be charcoal tinted for about 10 days.  This part is normal for everybody.  You replace the old carbon and soak the new for 48 hours.  For the next 72 hours, you have to bypass the system when you use laundry of dishwasher.  For me it took much longer.  I have spent $350 and engaged in a month long process, just to complete the media replacement that needs to be done every five years.\n",

Good thing it didnt happen the day before I was supposed to arrive.I was offered a $5 off coupon for my trouble.  An appropriate response would be to reimburse me the difference between what it will cost me now and the prepaid amount I originally contracted.  No.  None of that.

      "I ordered a phone case from them back in 2014 (that is still in excellent shape today) but I bought a new iphone and needed a new case so decided to order from them again. The new custom case I received was absolutely horrible, totally green in color so I requested to return it for a credit to get another case and they just issued me a credit within  hours of my request and I didn’t even need to return that ugly green case. I ordered another custom case that  arrived today and the  print quality is just as awesome as the one I ordered back in 2014. Very happy I didn’t just give up on them, they really do amazing custom print phone cases (my green colored one must have been a miss quality control but they rectified it without any problems) Thank you Zazzle, you have a customer for life!\n",

I was given 5 days to change my mind. Not crazy about that  time frame but I understand.   I specifically wanted average billing and the ability to set alert usage text etc..I have those now. I was relayed my provider had that I could access the online once I had an account number.  They do have alerts and average billing is for the immediate 3 months before the bill not the last 12 months like other providers offer.  I wish that info had been relayed to me, it would've been a game changer.  Also the online doesn't have all the bells and whistles the other provider has. I had to call their cust svc to turn on avg billing and he didn't know what it was or how to do it.  It took an hour to find someone who did and we will see what happens on my 1st bill.   When my 12 months are up I will shop around again but wont trust that your rep isn't  selling me out to closing out a call.\n",

Tried on line.  didn't work.  called in and someone walked me through it.  I wanted a customized verse.  I requested writing on front of card in silver and inside verse in red.  When the front turned to red also, I was assured that notes were made and the correction would be made.  When I received the proof to approve, the verse was so small one couldn't read it to tell if it was correct or not...it looked like a postage stamp on a field of white..  Called told it would be corrected...it wasn't when I received another request to approve.  2-3 weeks later FINALLY got some one (I think it was Brandy) who finally got it right, increased the font size on the verse and who took the time to explain that in order to have the name on the outside of the card in a different color from the verse it was an additional $100 plus dollars...Fine, just don't know why that wasn't told to me by the first 3-4 people I spoke with and why the writing in the verse was ever made so small.  The cards look great now\n",

      "I ordered an engraved stethoscope from Medisave and chose the $13 fedex delivery option (only a few more dollars than the cheapest delivery option). My order was placed on a Sunday and received by Wednesday. Medisave sent me emails during the entire process including when my order was received, sent to fedex, and delivered by fedex along with the tracking info for my package so I could track it on the fedex website as well. I had a question about a code I needed to gain full access to the Littmann learning app and received prompt attention by their chat option on the Medisave website. My inquiry was handled quickly and I also immediately received an email containing my chat interaction and to make sure I was satisfied. Highly recommend this company plus their engraving was cheaper than other websites, came out exactly as expected, and faster delivery than other websites quoted for engraved stethoscopes. I will use Medisave in the future for my medical supply needs\n",

      "At first I was quite happy to discover PartsGeek on-line to supply parts for my total re-build of a 1993 Eurovan.  Their web site was easy to use and to find the parts I needed so I ordered a large number of parts.  Unfortunately, the first time I had a question about a certain part I was only able to contact this group on-line and even though I tried several times my question was never directly answered.  Next, one of the parts I received - one of two tie rod ends - did not fit because the inner threads had not been cut correctly.  It was obviously a manufacturer's problem but again, I could only contact PartsGeek via the web and was not able to talk with someone directly about the problem.  Even the phone number given on the web site resulted in a recorded message telling me to  contact them through the web.  I applied for a \"return item\" number and wrote an explanation of the problem but the process was treated as if I had ordered the wrong part and was my fault.  I had to pay the shipping costs to return the part and then was charged a re-stocking fee.  That was bad enough but I had a feeling that the information about the problem part would be lost and the part would be returned to the shelf and re-sold, causing the same problem for the next person.  This suspicion was confirmed when I was ready to install the water pump I bought from PartsGeek.  When I received the pump via UPS I had opened the box and took a quick look inside and the pump looked fine.   The part sat in the box while I worked on the engine.  When I finally took the part out I realized that it had been sold to someone before - there were bolt/washer pressure marks on the install holes - and been returned.  The problem was that the pump had been returned with the first buyer's used, rusty and brittle O-ring and no one at PartsGeek bothered to notice.\r\n",
      "My bad experiences would not have happened if  PartsGeek had an effective Customer Service department where a customer can contact a real, live person on the phone an discuss and resolve problems.  Until PartsGeek does this I will not buy parts from them and will caution others to do the same.\n",

      "I ordered e-cards as I was in a time crunch and the site said orders would be available within 24 hours.  However, the site did not say that orders would be sent ONCE VERIFIED BY PHONE and it took 2 days for me to actually talk to someone before the vouchers were sent.  Every time I called the number noted in the email, I rec'd a recording saying all representatives were busy and someone would call me back.  We played phone tag (as I was at work during the day and am not allowed personal calls) for 48 hours which delayed my delivery.   The gift cards were for a basket for Nurse's Week and we almost did not make the deadline---which we easily would have made if the vouchers had been sent as promised.  I still do not understand the \"verification\" process; they wanted my name, address and charge card---information that I had already provided.  I appreciated the discount on the cards, but it was not as easy getting the cards as advertised.\n",
      "It took 2 techs nearly 9 hours to complete the entire process for our small home (under 1200 sq ft.), this was just too long in my opinion. The installation techs were friendly and polite, however, the lead tech made an error when calculating the sensors in my package and I ended up having to pay out of pocket, when I had already made it clear I did not want to do. This package was already discussed over the phone when I set up the appointment, so I did not appreciate the pressure and hassle of having to revisit this. And to further emphasize, I was told over the phone that I would get 2 key fobs, but this was part of the tech's error the day of installation. I'm not a fan of pushy salespeople and so far that is what I have encountered with ADT, throwing in extra yard signs is not my idea of a deal. From what I can tell, the system works fine and we feel safe and that's what matters, but as far as my interactions over the phone and with the installation techs I was not impressed by their honesty or efficiency.\n",

      "Fully disappointed by the experience we have endured with this company. We were sent a sick cleaner 2 months ago who gave its virus to our 6 months old baby. We contacted the company to ask for a refund as they promise and offer on their website if the customer isn't satisfied with the service. After sending various emails, we had requested them to cancel our account. This has happened in October and we still have not seen the money back neither they had cancelled our account. Thinking that we had no more ties to this company, suddenly they withdrew an other £20 from our account for a cleaner we have never seen. They had sent an email to let us know that someone would come to clean the place the following day. Did we not ask them to cancel? We refused the cleaner and yet got charged for a service we never received. One, they took the freedom to not cancel our account and secondly, from their policy, they could still charge the fee because we had not cancelled within they agreed window. Oofff!!! This is naughty, naughty, isn't it? Anyway, I hope the saga is over after all the extra emails we have sent.  Please, do answer and justify your unlawful behaviour.\n",
      "Once again, we've ordered a product from Sceenprinting.com and they have fallen short. The product was a Little Buddy 120V conveyor dryer. The product itself was easy to assemble. The problem is the company fails to mention that the plug is not a standard 110-120V plug. It specifically says, \"Versatile 120v standard power supply\" and also says, \"Heater plug type: NEMA 5-20P.\" But the heater plugs into a central control panel. The \"standard power supply\" (ie., standard plug) is not standard at all. You need a 5-15P To 5-20R Adapter (20A minimum). A good one will run about $15 on Amazon. This may not seem like a big deal, but after three botched orders from Screenprinting.com, it IS a big deal because every time we've set out to get things set up, each error has caused us a week in loss time.\n",

      "2. Remote needs to have more button options to navigate faster, like a one touch \"last channel\" option. \n",
      "3. Would be nice to have extra buttons on the remote in order to \"Preset\" channels we watch a lot.  Or, better yet, a screen we can navigate to that allows this option. \n",
      "4. The \"OK/Enter\" button should be in the center of the arrows buttons (up, down, left, right), not below it for easier access.  \n",
      "5. The \"Guide\" bar should be set up differently where we don't have to toggle all the way to the right or left through every channel to get to the channel that we want to watch.  \n",
      "6. Not enough local channels.\n",
      "7. Would be nice to have a \"DVR\" type function/option for shows/sports/movies we may not be able to watch at the time it's on.  This option should be included in the Orange/Blue option since we are paying for the higher tier package already.  Maybe this would entice more customers to pay for the higher tier package which would benefit Sling TV monetarily. \n",
      "8. How about a delete option to remove some channels that we don't want to watch or never watch that is on the guide bar.  For example, we are never going to watch \"Campus TV\" or the Spanish Channels, just to name a few. Waste of our money and space on the guide bar and again, the frustration of having to scroll through every one of those unwanted channels.\n",
      "9. How about offering bundled packages for Sports instead of one price for NFL, another for NHL, another for MLB, etc.  Also, I would pay a little more to be able to watch our local teams on the days they are actually playing, instead of watching those games days later.  By then we know who won or lost, so what's the point?\n",
      "10. How about rearranging the guide. Let's put the sports channels near the other sports channels, the movie channels with other movie channels, the news channels with the other news channels, the regular entertainment channels with the other entertainment channels, etc and so on and so on, instead of the jumbled mess that it is on the guide. Example:  NFL channel is currently all the way to the left and ESPN on the far opposite side of the guide bar.  Again, it brings back the frustration of having to scroll through every channel from one end of the spectrum to the other.  There's no rhyme or reason for how the channels are set up currently.\n",
      "11. Maybe place numbers on the remotes and then assign \"channel\" numbers to the programs in a guide to navigate easier and faster. You know, like a regular remote? Only having the up, down, left, right buttons is not enough and very primitive.\n",

      "4. Finally, only a small minority of the employees I've come across have been even close to friendly. I don't have to use WallyPark; I would rather park in an uncovered lot further away and pay friendly, accommodating people than park at your nicer garage and deal with non-chalant attitudes and very poor customer service skills.\r\n",

      "I needed to add a second magazine and ended up purchasing three magazines as I could not easily edit my order. I didn't want the third magazine but I was so frustrated I just paid for it. Also, the website says that any orders over $100 that shipping was free and it was not free.\n",
      "I am really disappointed from my macy's experience on July 7th,2017, I sent an order as a gift to my cousin house that were expected by somebody to travel for a wedding in the caraibes but ended in a different state. I still cannot digest this situation because the woman who received the package called me thank GOD said that she was gonna return it to a macy's but after she did not return my calls back and now the macy's customer service processed a wrong return on my macy's card . I don t really have time for situation like that but these people do not understand anyway it is frustrating too much waste of my time.......\n",
      "Best price I could find for what I bought, and I shop pretty hard when I am buying online. I would give 5 stars except there was no shipment notification or tracking information given.  A week after ordering, I had to call to check on my order, was told it would ship that day or the next, and it then arrived the following day. (I selected regular ground shipping, so didn't expect it to arrive much sooner than that but since it was a business purchase, needed to know when to expect it.) Also, item apparently drop shipped from mfr, (if that was noted on the listing I didn't see it) which I would have liked to have known as that usually adds to shipping time. They did not tell me that when I called, either.  That said, I received my items by the time I needed and was very pleased with them. Will definitely shop with them in the future.\n",
      "I ordered a gift card on 6/6/14. I received an email that it was shipped 4 days later on 6/10/14.  Today is the 14th and I have not received it.   I can't imagine how it could take 4 days to ship out a gift card  from the time it was ordered?  I've received multiple emails asking for a review before I've even received it.  For that reason, I am giving a two star rating.\n",
      "I feel like I've wasted 2 months of my life for a lousy $75.  I was sitting on a couple of gift cards that I couldn't really use, so I decided to sell them.  When I started the process in July, there weren't many reviews for this company, but the ones available were ok.  I signed up, sent my cards and received word on August 6th that there were received. After waiting for a few weeks, I finally email on September 11th to let them know I haven't received my check.  They give me a song and dance, and ask me not to cash a BankCorp check because they'll stop payment.  I finally receive the check on September 21st, but it is from BankCorp and it was dated SEPTEMBER 17th! Six days after I was assured they had already sent a check and it was lost.  I was literally about to deposit it today, October 1st, when I receive an email stating they just sent my replacement check.  There are no live phone operators, and even when you complain, they twist and manipulate timelines and make every excuse in the world.  My guess is they're robbing Peter to pay Paul and this isn't a business in good financial standing. I'd go elsewhere to sell your gift cards.\n",

      "I must admit I was nervous ordering a 1.77 carat ring online.  However, the ring is everything Brilliance said it would be.  My fiancé and I have verified the ring is authentic and exactly as advertised.  We took the ring to two different local jewelers.  Both the representatives at the jewelry stores where very impressed with the ring, as are most people that see the ring.  Both of the jewelers told me they couldn’t beat the price I paid for the ring.  I also was able to see the GIA laser inscription under a microscope at the jewelry store.  My fiancé was adamant about not ordering a ring online.  However, the diamond we bought is almost a full carat larger than similarly priced rings we saw at major, name brand jewelry stores.  My fiancé and I couldn’t be happier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

Five stars for you\n",

Their website is very easy to navigate and checkout is fast and simple, plus their prices are better than most of the other online comic stores.\n",
      "I ordered the expensive product with expedited shipping for a birthday present for my 10 year old son.  Two days later they contacted me saying they had to confirm my order due to security reasons because my shipping and billing address were different. I have regularly ordered from sites with a different shipping and billing addresses and have never run across this issue.  This chewed up 2 days.  They assured me that they would overnight the product so that it would arrive by the birthday on Friday.  When I received the tracking info it said it would arrive by Monday.  When we finally did get the delivery, it was the WRONG product!!!!  After all of that my son had to wait even longer to get his gift! So disappointing.  They did credit the shipping and gave me a measly 10% off of my order and still expected me to send the wrongly ordered product back to them.  I think better customer service would have been to suggest I keep the other item rather than dealing with the hassle of sending back something that was their mistake.\n",
      "First time ordering, found the website easy to use and navigate.  I chose my base template, made some minor edits, and quickly uploaded my company logo.  Placed my order (saved about 5% over other sites I looked at), and had confirmation emails within a couple minutes.\r\n",

      "The cards arrived in a matter of days, carefully packaged as to not get damaged in transit.  The print of the return address on the envelopes was well done, clean, and perfectly centered.  The print on the cards themselves was also immaculate.  The most impressive part was the weight of the card stock used.  Nice, thick paper that has proven to be a good solid card (shouldn't get mangled in the mail).\r\n",

      "Then I received a package of men's briefs from them and a shipping charge on my credit card.   I thought my son had ordered it using the \"store credit\", which I didn't even know that I had.  My son didn't order it. There was no order confirmation in his email. So, maybe they generated it; who knows.  Anyway, I worked for an Internet retailer for 9 years so I should have known better than to order from such an amateur website.  I requested a return of my remaining credit, but don't expect to receive it.\n",

Their idiotic shipping policies, which they tried to blame on FedEx, that refused to allow FedEx to resend or allow me to pick up myself.  This resulted in it eventually being returned for basically no reason other then Buydig not wanting me to actually receive the on sale TV.  Their policy is that when a thing is returned you have to re-buy it, of course the return process takes so long that by the time you eventually get your money back, I still haven't after 3 or so weeks, the sale is off and you now have to pay normal price. \n",

After much effort to find someone who could take care of our dogs while we should be abroad - without result - a friend made us aware of TrustedHousesitters. We signed up as homeowners only 2-3 weeks before we were going on vacation. Time passed and we received no answers. Our holiday was very close, and we had almost given up to travel. Then TrustedHousesitters let us out as a matter of urgency, and it gave results.

A little while after setting it up, we both attempted to request that the ownership information was changed into her name and company name - mainly for accounting purposes. However, I kept receiving the bills and was sent a couple of reminders, including interest incurred. Upon attempting to contact One.com by email (you can only do this online, so no telephone option), I did not hear anything back to confirm my previous requests had been received to change ownership. Instead, today I received an email from a debt collection company demanding the account is settled within 7 days. \r\n",

Upon challenging this further, I was met with very curt, confrontational responses from the manager who offered no willingness to help or resolve the matter - instead effectively arguing with me in a live chat exchange - to the extent where they were suggesting by offering me a sent date and time for the link they apparently sent me for the handover form (which I didn't receive), was proof that I had received and read the changeover form:\r\n",

These felt \"wrong\" when wearing them...as if my vision was skewed. A local optician checked the prescription, and showed me that the Pupil Distance was pretty far off! I wrote to FDs support, and was quickly contacted by JenniferC, who almost immediately sent me an RMA number. Returning the sungalasses took way too long, more than a month in transit (Christmas and all), but even BEFORE Jennifer had received my RMA frames, a new pair of Velocitys had been ordered, prepared and sent to me (I live in Denmark).\n",

Unfortunately not me. I'm really sorry that they couldn't make them for me, because I love their glass/lens quality (and have for many years).\n",

      "I booked a trip for my daughter using this company as booking direct with the carrier was not an option.  I booked for my daughter and three friends.  The trip involved three flights there and three back.  On the day they were due to fly out I received boarding passes for everyone except my daughter (who happened to be lead passenger) I called and was put on hold for about 30 minutes.  I was then told that I would receive the boarding pass in 4-6 hours and that the matter had been escalated.  Next morning I called at 6.00am and again told I had a waiting time of 15 minutes, 10 minutes later I had a waiting time of, you guessed it, 15 minutes.  At approximately 7.00pm I got through to a very nice lady who sympathised with me and turned out no escalation had occurred the day before.  I received the boarding pass within two hours.  This also happened again a week later when my daughter was returning home.  Same problems getting through.  I contacted them via Facebook and even through LinkedIn (I got no response from Linkedin)  \n",
      "I was fortunate that I was able to take time away from my job to deal with this.  I was also lucky that my daughter wasn't at the airport at these times so we had some time.  I don't know what people who find themselves in this position at the airport do.  Also to note that when I looked for the number on the website the second time, I could not find a telephone number - I got this on Facebook.  This is when I came across some absolute horror stories of people being abandoned and having to spend a lot of money to get home with no help from this company.  I read one good review after reading over 150 - yes I made the time to do this as I was so angry that a company can perform in this manner.  So I am going to tell as many people as possible about this, through social networking and also by contacting the CEO via LinkedIn \n",

      "booked a flight, realized straight after that you can't use special characters, so a guy cancelled it for me and straight after i booked another flight correctly. The next day i found out the guy cancelled the wrong reservation. i spoke with \"Sarah\" who tried charging me an extra $50 per ticket. It was probably thee worst experience I've ever had with a customer service representative. She raised her voice and told me it was my fault. I realized i was not getting anywhere with her and asked to speak to her supervisor. She came back 10 mins later and told me she would do this one time for me. like if she was doing me the favor. All and all i still asked to speak with  higher authority and again gave me attitude about that. \n",

      "George and the team at Playlist Push have been great!  Very transparent and responsive!  When we started the campaign we spoke with George the founder himself, he explained their methods and the best practices for his platform to help see greater success.  He was honest about the fact that success in a campaign like this is ultimately up to the strength of the song, but his platform will guarantee that curators at least listen and thoughtfully consider your song.  Spotify promo is a difficult business to be in because there are a lot of horror stories but if you only take one thing from this review it should be this: Playlist Push will do exactly what they say they're going to do.  In a world of over-promising and under-delivering that alone can be refreshing.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can choose to pitch to multiple playlist genres, dance/indie rock/folk/pop etc., and the people who see the most success usually do two or three. For our first time out of the gate we just went with a single genre, because you pay per genre and we were looking at this as our test case. Our campaign saw a growth of over 400% on our monthly listeners and even after the campaign ended our song is still enjoying rapid growth.  The curators provided feedback on why they did or did not choose the song and I was able to understand the thought process.  \n",

      "As a small biz owner - I make allll the decisions and do alllll the work...I needed new packaging for my spices with a mental criteria that demanded satisfaction and I needed it swiftly. Ordered 3 sample bags which came quickly - played with them and placed my order. The bags I had used previously were bought online and I took a risk sight unseen- they were alright to begin with but were problematic. Do yourself a favor and get yo’ bags here...\n",
      "We were very disappointed in the general condition and cleanliness of our room. We had to constantly re-login to the wifi. The picture on the very old TV was not clear. The people in the office were not at all helpful in recommending local places for dinner or breakfast. We opted for one room key rather than spend $5 for a second key. Not very good value for $90.\n",

      "I was apprehensive about putting my nervous, timid cat in a cattery for 6weeks while I had to go away so registered on Trustedhousesitters. I was anxious how it would work but the whole experience from start to finish was beyond what I hoped. The TrustedHousesitters team were on hand to offer advice and support if needed and I secured a sitter with ease who turned out to be reliable, personable, patient (with my nervous cat), honest, trustworthy and respectful to my cat and home. You can seek police checked sitters and read past reviews that provides reassurance before you make any agreements. It maybe that I was lucky with my sitter but there are plenty of registered sitters to enable you to be selective and scrutinise if felt needed. I would definitely use again.\n",

I googled the part and it said it was for a 2006 chevy malibu. I thought well maybe this is just another part thats the same (some parts are the same kind as the malibu) so i had my mechanic put the part in. THE PART DID NOT WORK!!!!!

      "I purchased a Laptop $600.- from HP (HP Laptop 15Z000) I am disappointed. Shipping was good. After 2 weeks the Laptop turned it self off. Called Customer service, they pushed on me a 3 Year warranty and the McAffee virus program this cost me over $200.-. They told me after that we can fix the problem. After several days and hours with a technician I think the problem was fixed. Then I had a problem with my touchpad, still have the problem. Called HP, I thought I had a warranty, not so the $200.- 3 year warranty was only for software problems. Now I have a hardware problem. It is not covered under this warranty. My touchpad is very sensitive, tried to adjust it with software, no luck. often the pointer jumps around, then deleting in the middle of writing a letter or email half of it and had to rewrite again. Opens up automatically websites. The touchpad left and right click is horrible, have to touch only a small section of the right or left button so it get recognized. The turn on button is not good at all. It is a small rectangle bar. When you push this button you don't know, did it turn on the Laptop or not. Because it takes a while until the hp logo appears on the screen. No other sign of life. A round start button with a light coming on would be great. I would not recommend Hp to buy a computer. Customer service tries to sell you only warranties. Searched online what I should do with my Touchpad. Recommendation is Live with it, because when you send it to Hp repair you have to deal on the end only with more problems.\n",

      "The plants I received were packed very well for shipment and were strong, healthy specimens.  However, we’re still practically in winter here in western NY and there was no way I could put them into my garden which was still very wet and snow covered.  I read that they could stand temps as low as 26, so I put them into pots on my patio and, even though it’s been 10 days and I still can’t plant them where I want them, they look terrific. \n",

      "The site was easy to use.   The check-out was a good experience. I liked the 50% off for a few hours. Also the dimensions chart for S, M, L, or XL, was very useful because these things are different in other companies. YOu could be ordering a M and you get a L or vice versa.\r\n",
      "The shipping might have been a little high for two T-Shirts.\n",
      "Shipping was crazy expensive. This needs to be corrected. I paid a 1/4 more in shipping costs. I was prepared to pick the item up at the store. This is very deceptive and frustrating. I would suggest you figure out another alternative. I could have drove to Chicago and picked it up myself and drove back for cheaper than what you charge. How about give people the option to pickup at the store for no charge. Dont plan on going back and still on the fence about cancelling my order. \n",

      "Years of trail running and mogul skiing had left my knees in continual pain. When my Ortho doc had no solution and suggested it was time to give up running and skiing, I was devastated. Having heard of stem cell therapy, I made the easy decision to give it a try. My first treatment fall 2015 provided great results with pain free bump skiing that winter. Spring running revealed some dull pain though, so I had a second treatment summer 2016. The result is amazing! I'm running and skiing as fast and as hard as ever at 62 years old. This science is very real and incredibly effective.\n",

      "I found the prices to be excellent, and when I followed through with the confirmation number, all was set.  My only issue was the tickets went down in price significantly within 2 days, but that is not their fault!   Economy shifts!  Dang!  I should have bided my time a little longer!\n",

One of the boxes just looked shredded and was untapped so it looked like people have opened them before.. For buying \"New\" products, sure didn't look that way!\n",
      "I took a chance and bought the Plush Soft because of the reviews on their customer service as well as their mattresses. Unfortunately, even this mattress was too firm for me and they were wonderful. They had the delivery service come and remove the mattress and refunded all but the initial delivery fee as expected. We are moving out of the country so we knew that if the mattress was not for me we would not be taking it with us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every other vendor could learn from this. Try the mattresses! It was very well made and in pristine condition. I used a mattress protector and I kept it covered with a clean protector for the few days it took the delivery service to come get it. I wish they had one soft enough for me. I looked at Mattress Firm and the softest one in the store was $3600 for just the king mattress. So we will tolerate our old mattress and get a new one when we get to our new country. So sorry I could not keep the mattress. They deserve the business!\n",
      "The fees are a little excessive. The merchandise takes too long to ship and the first framed jersey that I ordered arrived damaged. I suspect its more on UPS than prestige but I contacted two people at prestige  regarding the broken case and I haven't received any communication back. I spent nearly$2000 in my first month as a member. I might not make anymore purchases if the damaged item is not remedied to my satisfaction. I like the auction style and the site works great. The merchandise is fairly decent but shipping and packaging are certainly an issue. Even the framed jerseys that weren't damaged have marks on the frame from the way it was packaged.\n",

I did all the work, then I had to ask for the itinerary after the 24 hour period.  There was a problem they created when booking the flight so I had to speak with American Airlines in order to get on their website to choose seats and enter frequent flyer info (how I came across the actual price of the tickets).

My debt was affecting my mental health. The burden was sort of mind-boggling once I really faced it. I am now normal again, without this huge problem in the back of my psyche. I am truly grateful for TCA. They got lower interest rates that I never could have gotten myself & my payments got deducted from my checking account each month. Nearly $50,000 debt paid off in 5 years, which amazed me. And now I need a vacation.\n",

I have tried a couple different exercise plans, crossfit, group fitness, personal training, and nothing has helped me loose weight except this program. I only wanted to lose about 10lbs. I've lost 15lbs and feel great. It's a combination of the workouts (that are not very long, very manageable without work & family) and eating right. Also I did buy the shakes (also reasonable priced) that taste really good (I tried Shakeology (disgusting) but probably didn't need to in order the shakes to lose the weight but I'm also a runner and needed the extra.
