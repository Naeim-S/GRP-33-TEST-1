    "Firstly an overall trend seem to be present for all sectors across all regions: Sectors experience a major drop in point elasticity from 2008 to 2009 before clustering at a positive point elasticity in 2011 cf. figure X.5. By 2012 major fluctuations occur for all regions and across all sectors, just as depicted in the previous figures and expected due to BNP being stable in 2012. The Capital Area and Region of Central Jutland have sectors with positive and negative point elasticities. Whereas the remaining three regions mainly see a possitve change in point elasticity. For Region Zealand only the trade-sector poses a negative relationship at 5-percentage relative change. From 2013 and onwards the point elasticities across sectors and within all regions seem to stabilize around zero.\n",

    "For specific sectors some general trends are worth noting: The social and educational sector generally show a negative point elasticity in 2010 and 2011. Both of these regionwide sector developments seem to match the overall development of sectors as previously presented with no region visibly over- or underperforming in terms of elasticities. Furthermore, on the region-wide level the trade-sector appears as the sector with the least fluctuation. \n",

    "On the level of jobtypes of sectors within areas we return to the four examples presented in the previous chapter of descriptive statistics. _Figure X_ plots development in GDP elasticity of labor demand for jobtypes in sectors IT and office work for the region Capital Area, and trade and industry for Zealand. Worth noting is that the jobtype of IT-courses in the Capital Area has been left out as the jobtype saw a rise from 1 to 175 going from 2013 to 2014. This prompted a degree of relative change at 17500 percent thus making the figure highly uninterpretable. Similar action has been taken towards the jobtype of office-courses for sector office work, as the level of relative change hit 300 percent, and thus was deemed a disturbing outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the regions of Capital Area as presented in figure x.6 a) and b), we find that jobtypes in the sector IT presents some diversity with jobtypes telecommunication and system development starting at a positive relationship and remaining jobtypes at a negative. With fluctuations splitting the relationship of jobtypes between both positive and negative, this even out by 2013 through to 2017, with some jobtypes briefly finding themselves at a negative relationship.\n",
    "For jobtypes in the sector of office work, all positions start at a positive relationship with point elasticities ranging from  20 to 60 percent. This seems to hold true through to 2012, with some jobtypes showing a negative relationship. By 2013 through 2017 jobtypes cluster at a level between 0 and 30 percent showing generally positive relationships with development in BNP. Translation stands out for the period until 2016 when it returns to the level of the remaining jobtypes.\n",

    "Figure x.6 c) and d) plots sectors industry and trade in Region Zealand. We find that a pattern similar occur to that in the Capital Area occurs. All jobtypes pose a positive relationship to development in BNP by 2007, dropping in level though to 2008. In 2009, a split occurs with jobtypes finding themselves close to the level of 0 percent and the sectors finding jobs that pose both positive and negative relationships. For the trade sector, delivery stands out in terms of point elasticity above 100 percent. With fluctuations in 2012 the trade sector finds a majority of jobs posing negative relationships with high levels of elasticities, whilst the industry sector shows a somewhat even distribution of jobtypes with positive- and negative relationships. For industry jobtypes electrician and paint show elasticities at 200 and 300 percent respectively. By 2013 to 2017 jobtypes in both sectors cluster and elasticities is generally in the range of minus 5 to plus 50 percent However, childcare in the trade sector shows a level of 100 percent in 2013."
