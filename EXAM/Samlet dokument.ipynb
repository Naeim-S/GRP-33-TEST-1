    "Through the past decade, the Danish economy has been characterized by both an economic boom, recession by the financial crisis and a current upswing. At the same time, a public debate about what is referred to as outskirts Denmark has taken place. The debate is about the burden of outer municipalities stemming from unemployment and emigration of workforce. This holds an underlying assertion that demand for labor is centralized to larger cities leaving outer areas with a lack of skilled workers. During the concerned time span, various governments have implemented multiple labor market reforms for different purposes. Reforms of social assistance and an ongoing repositioning of public institutions are examples of this. Hence Danish labor market has undergone fluctuating demand of labor as well as a restructuring caused by both political reforms and general labor demand centralization within the concerned ten year period. \n",
    "Subject to these issues, this paper will examine whether these assertions in the public debate about outskirts Denmark can be confirmed empirically and whether, how, when, and where, a restructuration in the labor market has occured."

    "Our inquiry will be performed with a focus on applying tools of social data science. Using Python through Anaconda we will be scraping data from the archive of Danish job portal JobIndex. This will serve as our primary source of data, supplemented by demographic and socioeconomic data gathered from the API offered by Statistics Denmark. The archive data is treated on different levels of development ranging from specific jobtypes within regions to nation-wide job sectors, and presented and examined through descriptive statistics. We will examine if the labour demand across regions have changed over the years in order to assess whether the labour demand truly has been subject to centralization towards the Capital Area. Furthermore, we will examine if the labour demand has redistributed amongst sectors over time in order to assess if certain sectors have experienced growth or decline. Finally, we conduct an analysis of the data, by which we compute and examine the elasticity between development in GDP and labour demand (as proxied through job postings on JobIndex) in order to assess the changes in labour demand relative to  the changes in general wealth in Denmark."

Thus, our dataset contains only data from 2007 and onwards as we believe this to be the period of time in which JobIndex data may properly be assumes to cover the near-true labor market demand. Job postings are divided by different characteristics: Area, job category and job type (with Job type being a subdivision of job category). Based on the archive we are able to obtain the number of job postings across year, area, job category and job type.   \n",

As society progress, demand for labor likely changes as well, and the amount of labor demanded within each industry may vary. Processing data for the demand side of the labor market enables an analysis of instant changes in geographical restructerings and expansion of certain sectors for instance. Labor supply may however react slowly to changes in demand, which is among causes of structural unemployment. Hence data for labor demand allows for greater insight into the future of the Danish labor market and unemployment levels."

For instance, even though archive did contain some information concerning which cities the companies of the job postings are from or which cities the actual jobs will take place in, we were not able to acquire this information with current skills. As thus, our obtained data holds some limitations in terms of narrowing the labor demand (based on job postings) down to specific cities rather than larger areas. Another limitation due to our process of scrapin is, that due to the way job categorization in the JobIndex archive occurs, some job postings are ambiguous and may occur in more than one job category. Therefore, simply summing job postings based on their job category or job type may result in a counting of duplicates. This makes it important to distinguish between the amount of job postings within each category and the total amount of job postings. In order to clarify this, our dataset will contain variables denoted as `\"N_[specification]\"` with `[specification]` being a general term for which characteristic is used (e.g. number of jobpostings in that area for that year or within that job type, area, or year)."

With the rise of other employment-oriented web-services such as LinkedIn in recent years, labor market demand may work by channels not covered in our data. Likewise, we believe that other channels of job posting and recruitment may follow informal networks, social-media websites like Facebook (who have recently incorporated recruitment in their [services](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/take-the-work-out-of-hiring)), and non-online means of communication like newspapers. Conclusions made from data singlehandedly by JobIndex are thus limited in the sense that the data does not provide a complete picture of labor market demand, prompting caution in making overly general remarks. In the specific Danish context, we believe it further possible that firms located in outskirt municipalities may more often choose not to post job offers in JobIndex for instance. This would result in a source of bias in any geografic related conclusion regarding demand of labor. "

This has been due to our data collecting process failing to sort out job postings for jobs abroad. That is, aggregated data for Denmark also includes foreign job postings. This mistake is relevant for Figure 1 and 2 in the following chapter _Descriptive analysis_ and for Figure ……….…….. in the analysis section. This flaw is especially relevant for job postings in the year 2015, with the amount of foreign job postings being more than tripled compared to 2014. Besides this, job postings for job abroad is somewhat stable around 8.000 – 17.000 job postings across all job categories. Due to time limitiations this flaw was not corrected, but we wish to emphasize our awareness of the issue and that we will keep this in mind moving onward."

    "Firstly an overall trend seem to be present for all sectors across all regions: Sectors experience a major drop in point elasticity from 2008 to 2009 before clustering at a positive point elasticity in 2011 cf. figure 11. By 2012 major fluctuations occur for all regions and across all sectors, just as depicted in the previous figures and expected due to BNP being stable in 2012. The Capital Area and Region of Central Jutland have sectors with positive and negative point elasticities. Whereas the remaining three regions mainly see a possitve change in point elasticity. For Region Zealand only the trade-sector poses a negative relationship at 5-percentage relative change. From 2013 and onwards the point elasticities across sectors and within all regions seem to stabilize around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For specific sectors some general trends are worth noting: The social and educational sector generally show a negative point elasticity in 2010 and 2011. Both of these regionwide sector developments seem to match the overall development of sectors as previously presented with no region visibly over- or underperforming in terms of elasticities. Furthermore, on the region-wide level the trade-sector appears as the sector with the least fluctuation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into sectors on the region-specific level we find that Region of Zealand differ from other regions with lower point elasticities in 2010. The highest degree of point elasticity in Region Zealand is found in the trade sector at 10 percent, thus showing that the region had little perforance for the year 2010 as related to other regions.\n",

    "## Development on the level of jobtypes in sectors within areas  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the level of jobtypes of sectors within areas we return to the four examples presented in the previous chapter of descriptive statistics. Figure 12 plots development in GDP elasticity of labor demand for jobtypes in sectors IT and office work for the region Capital Area, and trade and industry for Zealand. Worth noting is that the jobtype of IT-courses in the Capital Area has been left out as the jobtype saw a rise from 1 to 175 going from 2013 to 2014. This prompted a degree of relative change at 17500 percent thus making the figure highly uninterpretable. Similar action has been taken towards the jobtype of office-courses for sector office work, as the level of relative change hit 300 percent, and thus was deemed a disturbing outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the regions of Capital Area as presented in Figure 12 a) and b), we find that jobtypes in the sector IT presents some diversity with jobtypes telecommunication and system development starting at a positive relationship and remaining jobtypes at a negative. With fluctuations splitting the relationship of jobtypes between both positive and negative, this even out by 2013 through to 2017, with some jobtypes briefly finding themselves at a negative relationship.\n",
    "For jobtypes in the sector of office work, all positions start at a positive relationship with point elasticities ranging from  20 to 60 percent. This seems to hold true through to 2012, with some jobtypes showing a negative relationship. By 2013 through 2017 jobtypes cluster at a level between 0 and 30 percent showing generally positive relationships with development in BNP. Translation stands out for the period until 2016 when it returns to the level of the remaining jobtypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 12 c) and d) plots sectors industry and trade in Region Zealand. We find that a pattern similar occur to that in the Capital Area occurs. All jobtypes pose a positive relationship to development in BNP by 2007, dropping in level though to 2008. In 2009, a split occurs with jobtypes finding themselves close to the level of 0 percent and the sectors finding jobs that pose both positive and negative relationships. For the trade sector, delivery stands out in terms of point elasticity above 100 percent. With fluctuations in 2012 the trade sector finds a majority of jobs posing negative relationships with high levels of elasticities, whilst the industry sector shows a somewhat even distribution of jobtypes with positive- and negative relationships. For industry jobtypes electrician and paint show elasticities at 200 and 300 percent respectively. By 2013 to 2017 jobtypes in both sectors cluster and elasticities is generally in the range of minus 5 to plus 50 percent However, childcare in the trade sector shows a level of 100 percent in 2013.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "For this paper we have used the number of job postings in Jobindex's archive as a proxy for labor demand. This has allowed for us to analyze geographical restructurings and changes over time. Even though Jobindex demm themselves as the largest register of available jobs in Denmark (Jobindex 31/8-2018 21.49), the amount of job postings in Jobindex is not an exact measure of total demand for labor. Jobindex is not a complete register of job ads and thus naturally omit job postings passed through other channels. Some jobs may be advertised locally or may never reach Jobindex before the job is taken. Our data set then presents statistics about demand for labor however not to be interpreted as total demand for labor in Denmark. Alternatively, if time allowed us to do so, we could gather data from multiple job registers in order to obtain comprehensive data. For instance scraping of competing databases such as Jobnet.dk or turning to local job advertisers could contribute to an adequate data set. Whether there is any correlation between omitted job postings in Jobindex and job types, job category, area or year is unknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our data collecting process has not been entirely efficient. Apart from Jobindex not being a complete register of job postings in Denmark, data also lack the consistency of purposely including or excluding job postings abroad. This is a mistake that comes from the scraping process when defining appropriate URLs. Jobs abroad thus come to add noise in parts of our data set. The number of job postings from abroad is somewhat constant except in 2015, thus resulted noise in data mainly revolves around 2015. Re-scraping Jobindex was not an option due to time limits not permitting the work load of doing so. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also some noise in data occurring from our merging of areas defined by Jobindex into regions. For instance, Northern Zealand, Bornholm and the Greater Area of Copenhagen was matched in the region Capital area. This is geographically correct, but some job postings may occur in more than one area within the region. Adding these three areas together may result in duplicates that are not dealt with. Noise in data stemming from this causes bias in data involving regions of Capital area and Southern Denmark. The number of job postings for these regions are overstated by approximately 10 percent for Region of Capital area and 5 percent for Region of Southern Denmark. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "First, examining the labour demand in the regions over time (both in absolute numbers and relative to WAP) it is clear that the Capital Area has the highest labour demand. Yet, when comparing the relative change in job postings with the relative change in GDP, over time and across regions, it is not so prevalent whether the labour demand has been subject to centralization towards the capital area.   \n",
    "Since 2010 the GDP has been steadily increasing. Given that the GDP elasticity of labour demand in the capital area has been positive over the same period (as seen in figure X.4), indicates that the labour demand has increased overprorpotionately to GDP over the same period. Yet, when comparing the point elasticity of the capital area with the point elasticities of the other regions, the capital area doesn't always have a higher elasticity. As such, other regions seem to have a greater growth in labour demand, than the capital area, relative to the overall wealth growth in Denmark - which might indicate that the labour demand hasn't been subject to centralization towards the capital area, when factoring in the wealth growth in the Danish economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, when looking at the change in labour demand over time across the different job sectors (for all regions), we see that the sector of industry and craft along with the trade and service sector had the largest decrease from 2007 to 2017, with a decrease of 50%. In fact, only the IT sector has had a positive growth in labour demand during this period. Furthermore, the IT sector has also had the quickest recovery after the financial crisis, despite the social and health sector as well as the teaching sector having the lowest decrease in labour demand after the financial crisis. Thus, based on the absolute levels of labour demand there are indications of the labour demand switching into the IT sector from the industry and craft sector as well as the trade and service sector.\n",
    "Yet, given the GDP elasticity of labour demand in the IT sector has been positive over the same period (as seen in figure X.3), indicates that the labour demand in the IT sector has increased overprorpotionately to GDP over the same period. Yet, when comparing the point elasticity of the IT sector with the other sectors, it doesn't always have the highest elasticity. As such, many other sectors seem to have a greater growth in labour demand, than the IT sector, relative to the overall wealth growth in Denmark - which might indicate that the labour demand hasn't switched into the IT sector, when factoring in the wealth growth in the Danish economy."
