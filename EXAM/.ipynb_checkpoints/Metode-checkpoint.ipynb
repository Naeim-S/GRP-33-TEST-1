    "## Data source\n",
    "In order to analyse the **[*INSERT PART FROM PROBLEMFORMULERING STATING WHAT WE WANT TO ANALYSE*]** we have conducted a scpraing of data of all job postings on JobIndex in ther yearspan of 2007-2017, including both years. JobIndex gather supply and demand of labor and is the largest Danish job portal with 800.000 unique users every month (Source: https://www.jobindex.dk/cms/omjobindex/index.shtml). The site works as an index by fetching job postings from hundreds of different job offer sources. Their archive, the [JobIndex archive](https://www.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning?jobage=archive), contains all the job postings listed on their site since 1998, yet the amount of job postings prior to 2007 is very scarce (contains in total approximately 13.000 jobs postings). Thus, our dataset contains only data from 2007 and onwards as we believe this to be the period of time in which JobIndex data may properly be assumes to cover the near-true labor market demand. Job postings are divided by different characteristics: Area, job category and job type (with Job type being a subdivision of job category). Based on the archive we are able to obtain the number of job postings across year, area, job category and job type.   \n",
    "JobIndex has defined 13 different areas and 10 different Job Categories, where each job category contains various job types. \n",
    "Jobindex as data source allows for analysis of labor market demand across time and industries. As society progress, demand for labor likely changes as well, and the amount of labor demanded within each industry may vary. Processing data for the demand side of the labor market enables an analysis of instant changes in geographical restructerings and expansion of certain sectors for instance. Labor supply may however react slowly to changes in demand, which is among causes of structural unemployment. Hence data for labor demand allows for greater insight into the future of the Danish labor market and unemployment levels.  \n",

    "## Web scraping / data collection\n",
    "By inspecting the elements of the  archive's website we have obtained the part of the html code which contains the amount of job postings. This has been done by firstly, specifying the search across each year, area, job category and job type would alter the URL itself. This enables us to create a function returning an URL to a specific job type for each category and area. The URL takes the four characteristics as inputs (i.e. year, area, job category and job type).  \n",
    "Hence, it was important to be aware of multiple categories using the same URL. E.g. The job type \"Retail management\" occurs under the job category of both \"Trade and service\" as well as \"Management and staff\", yet they share the same URL. As such, URL-duplicates have been removed and the amount of job postings will be placed in the category specified by the URL.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, based on all the URL's acquired as presented above, we were able to scrape the amount of job postings across year, area, job category and job type by parsing through the HTML code and searching for the `h2` header and the class `search-title`. In order to collect the present amount of data we made sure to use a delay when scraping Jobindex.dk. Finally, a DataFrame which contained a column for year, area, job category and job type was created, and the amount of job postings across all characteristics were added to the DataFrame as a seperate column. As such, each row would cover a different combination of characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the scope of this paper, not all areas that JobIndex use for categorizaion will be used. Further, some areas are combined in order to represent the Danish Regions. Thus, Bornholm and Northern Zealand will be combined with the Capital Area to represent the Capital Region of Denmark. Funen will be combined with Southern Jutland in order to represent the Region of Southern Denmark. The five regions of Denmark (Capital Area, Zealand, Southern Denmark, Central Jutland and Northern Jutland) will be the areas that are used and examined in this paper. Job postings in the areas of Greenland, The Faroe Islands, Skaane and foreign countries will not be used, as these are not deemed within the scope of inquiry.\n",

Til slut merges de 11 dataset (1 dataset forhvert år), hvorefter et fuldendt datasæt der indeholder antallet af jobopslag for hvert oråde, sektor, jobtype og år.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data limitations\n",
    "The data the we have obtained by scraping the JobIndex archive does contain some limitations. For instance, even though archive did contain some information concerning which cities the companies of the job postings are from or which cities the actual jobs will take place in, we were not able to acquire this information with current skills. As thus, our obtained data holds some limitations in terms of narrowing the labor demand (based on job postings) down to specific cities rather than larger areas. Another limitation due to our process of scrapin is, that due to the way job categorization in the JobIndex archive occurs, some job postings are ambiguous and may occur in more than one job category. Therefore, simply summing job postings based on their job category or job type may result in a counting of duplicates. This makes it important to distinguish between the amount of job postings within each category and the total amount of job postings. In order to clarify this, our dataset will contain variables denoted as `\"N_[specification]\"` with `[specification]` being a general term for which characteristic is used (e.g. number of jobpostings in that area for that year or within that job type, area, or year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jobindex is not a complete library of all job postings between 2007 and 2017, but rather a collection of those posted on the online and within the range of the index. With the rise of other employment-oriented web-services such as LinkedIn in recent years, labor market demand may work by channels not covered in our data. Likewise, we believe that other channels of job posting and recruitment may follow informal networks, social-media websites like Facebook (who have recently incorporated recruitment in their [services](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/take-the-work-out-of-hiring)), and non-online means of communication like newspapers. Conclusions made from data singlehandedly by JobIndex are thus limited in the sense that the data does not provide a complete picture of labor market demand, prompting caution in making overly general remarks. In the specific Danish context, we believe it further possible that firms located in outskirt municipalities may more often choose not to post job offers in JobIndex for instance. This would result in a source of bias in any geografic related conclusion regarding demand of labor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect of limiations in our Jobindex dataset, is aggregation of daily observations to annual observations. This has been an active choice on our behalf, as accounting for daily observations would make the data set too large to handle with present time and skill. However this comes at the cost, that due to an aggregation into annual observations the data set comes to lack exact timing of events posing an effect on the daily or monthly basis of job postings, as well as information of seasonal variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### An unresolved issue\n",
    "\n",
    "The day before deadline we discovered a flaw in our data collecting process: Data from Jobindex for the number of job postings by area did not sum to the total number of job postings in Denmark in our data set. This has been due to our data collecting process failing to sort out job postings for jobs abroad. That is, aggregated data for Denmark also includes foreign job postings. This mistake is relevant for Figure 1 and 2 in the following chapter _Descriptive analysis_ and for Figure ……….…….. in the analysis section. This flaw is especially relevant for job postings in the year 2015, with the amount of foreign job postings being more than tripled compared to 2014. Besides this, job postings for job abroad is somewhat stable around 8.000 – 17.000 job postings across all job categories. Due to time limitiations this flaw was not corrected, but we wish to emphasize our awareness of the issue and that we will keep this in mind moving onward.\n",
