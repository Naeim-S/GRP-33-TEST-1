    "## Descriptive analysis\n",
    "This section provides a descriptive analysis of the development in labor demand in Denmark between 2007 and 2017. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data for figures in this section is presented as per person in working age population. Working age population will be referred to as _WAP_. This is done on the merit, that aboslute numbers of job postings do not provide clarity of labor demand itself without some kind of comparable scale inbetween sectors and aras. Using data per WAP thus allows for comparison across characteristics. Job postings per WAP is calculated as the number of job postings divided with the total number of inhabitants in Denmark or within regions for individuals aged 20-64 years. Population data is collected from Statistics Denmark. The population data used does not equal the actual labor force, seeing as not every individual is available for the labor market. Though, the population data is deemed approximately equal to labor supply. \n",

    "### Levels of development  \n",
    "\n",
    "When examining the development in job postings across time for sectors, areas, and job types, we would be conducting an inquiry on three different levels: First, we examine the overall trend of development on the area- and sectorwide level. Secondly, we examine the development of all sectors across for the various areas. Finally, we will perform a sample examination of the development within certain sectors or within certain areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the third level we will be examining the amount of job postings for specific job types. It is important to emphasize that we will be examining a small number of job postings when looking at job types, as minor variations in data sets containing few observations may appear as massive changes. For some job types there are very few job postings why excessive interpreting of development within job types may be misleading. \n",

    "### WAP or unemployment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 illustrates the total number of job postings in Jobindex as both per WAP and per unemployed individual in Denmark for the period of 2008 to 2016 (years limited by available data for unemployment). Initial demand for labor is the maximum level for the period with more than one job posts for every ten people in working age population. In only two years, during the financial crisis, the number of job posts is cut in half. Afterwards, demand for labor rises slowly to almost initial level. Job postings relative to the number of unemployed reveal a similar drop in 2009. Over a five year period the number of job postings per unemployed drops from 4.2 to 1.5 posts per unemployed. \n",

    "The drop in job postings shown in Figure 1 is elaborated in Figure 2. Figure 2 illustrates the number of job postings by job sector for 2007 to 2017. Every category is exposed to significant decrease in demand of labor in 2008 and 2009. Number of available jobs in the industry sector in 2009 is 71 percent lower compared to the year before. Also IT experienced a large drop in job postings in the same period. Meanwhile teaching and social and health sectors had the lowest drop in job postings at 31 percent from 2008 to 2009. Though, social and health is the only job category to continue to this drop until 2010. The IT-sector shows the fastest recovery in 2010 with 62 percent higher number of job postings, though this may be partly due to a low absolute value for job postings. In 2015 there was an equal intensification in demand for teaching and IT however only taking place for one year. Considering the ten year period, IT is the only job category with an overall increased demand for labor. Trade and industry on the other hand both had 50 percent fewer job postings in 2017 compared to 2007. \n",

    "An overview of the number of job postings per WAP by region is provided in figure 3. In 2007, the region of Northern Jutland and region of Zealand are underperforming. However, by 2009 both regions share approximately the same level of job postings per WAP as the regions of Central and Southern Jutland. For all regions, the number of job postings is cut in half in two years going from 2007 to 2009. From 2009 and onwards the amount of job postings slowly rises. The Capital Area is unique in the sense that compared to the region of Zealand, it constantly has twice the number of job posts per WAP. That is, most of labor demand takes place in the capital area. \n",

    "The regions Capital Area and Zealand are the regions with the highest and lowest demand for labor respectively. Figure 4 further examines differences in the number of job postings within job categories causing deviating labor demand in these areas. Job posts for teaching and social work are dominating in the region of Zealand. These are typically jobs in the public sector and the amount of job postings is thus less dependent of area taking population size into account. A major difference between the two regions is that demand for labor in IT and office work is considerably higher in the Capital Area. Drops in demand for labor in the industry and trade sectors for both regions contribute to the overall intense drop in these categories for all of Denmark as previously illustrated in Figure 2. \n",

    "Job categories IT and office work in the capital area are of interest next, as IT is relatively large within the capital area and is the only job category with a higher demand of labor in 2017 relative to 2007. Office work is also of interest because of the high demand for labor compared to rest of Denmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graph a) in figure 5 divides job postings in the IT sector in the Capital Area into job types. The drop in job postings in IT in 2009 is mainly driven by lack of demand of labor in IT operations and especially system development. The latter is also primary cause in the overall positive growth in IT job postings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 5 graph b) highlights job postings in office work by job types in the Capital Area. The drop in job postings within office work is almost solely caused by lack of demand for labor in office, economy, finance and logistics, which all has at least 50 percent lower job postings in 2009 compared to 2008. \n",
    "\n",
    "The job category industry in Zealand, illustrated in figure 5 graph c), shows that the whole industry sector suffered hard during the financial crisis. Demand for labor were almost completely satisfied in 2009 and 2010 as the number of job postings were close to zero for every job type within the industry sector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hotel and cleaning and retail job types experience the largest decrease in job postings within the trade sector in 2009 cf. graph d) in figure 5. Since 2009 almost no growth in job types of the trade sector has been recorded apart from in retail 2014 to 2016. \n",

    "Finally, the sudden increase in job postings in 2015 for teaching and IT is investigated cf. figure 2. Figure 6 shows the average number of job postings in the IT sector across all areas. The jump in 2015 for IT that was noted in in figure 2 is now visibly caused by an increased demand for labor in system development. This job category today has more job postings than initially in 2007, which is quite unique as shown in earlier graphs. This demand is primarily located in Region Capital Area. \n",

    "Temporary increased demand for teaching staff in 2015 illustrated in figure 2 is mainly caused by increased foreign demand. As described in Data Limitations section, a mistake in our data collecting process resulted in data including job postings abroad. This is greatly reflected in labor demand in 2015 for teaching job category. \n",
