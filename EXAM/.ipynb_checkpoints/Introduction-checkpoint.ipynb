    "Through the past decade, the Danish economy has been characterized by both an economic boom, recession by the financial crisis and a current upswing. At the same time, a public debate about what is referred to as outskirts Denmark has taken place. The debate is about the burden of outer municipalities stemmming from unemployment and emigration of workforce. This holds an underlying assertion that demand for labor is centralized to larger cities leaving outer areas with a lack of skilled workers. During the concerned time span, various governments have implemented multiple labor market reforms for different purposes. Reforms of social assistance and an ongoing repositioning of public institutions are examples of this. Hence Danish labor market has undergone fluctuating demand of labor as well as a restructuring caused by both political reforms and general labor demand centralization within the concerned ten year period. \n",
    "Subject to issues above, this paper describes how assertions in the public debate about outskirts Danmark can be confirmed empirically and examines whether, how, when, and where, a restructuration in the labor market has occured. \n",

    "Our inquiry will be performed with a focus on applying tools of social data science. Using Python we will be scraping data from the archive of Danish job portal JobIndex. This will serve as our primary source of data, supplied by Danish national statistics gathered using the API offered by Statistics Denmark. The archive data is treated on different levels of development ranging from specific jobtypes within areas to nation-wide job sectors, and presented and examined using descriptive statistics. Finally, we conduct an analysis of the data using relative first differences, by which we plot the elasticity between development in nation BNP and job postings.\n",
    "\n",
    "By our inquiry we wish to resolve an overall question concerning, _what characterises the development in labor market demand and supply, as uncovered using job posting data as a proxy, for the years 2007 to 2017?_\n"
