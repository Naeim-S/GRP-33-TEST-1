Instead, what you should do, is either make a new notebook and write your solutions in there, or **make a copy of this notebook and save it somewhere else** on your computer, not inside the `sds` folder that you cloned, so you can write your answers in there. If you edit the notebook you pulled from Github, those edits (possible your solutions to the exercises) may be overwritten and lost the next time you pull from Github.

I realize this may not be a problem for some, but I use 2 Canon 5d Mark IIIs with battery grips and a 70-200mm on one camera with the dual strap ( attach the strap to the lens in this case), so they are heavy as camera rigs go and I don't like the distraction of re-tightening connector plates for fear of a camera becoming detached.

We signed up for a few house sitting websites and still find we are getting the most of our sits through the site. The community is great and they offer very good support. The worldwide reach is probably the best I have experienced across the sites we use regularly.  Sometimes searching for sits between specific dates doesn't work as expected which results in a lot of listing browsing, this lightning it be a problem for some, but if your full time house sitting it sometimes can be frustrating when searching for a specific window in the future. Cost wise there are cheaper sites, but it's still a very small amount of money to pay considering the value you save from just one night housesitting vs paying for a hotel.
